# fast_retag

Set or update mp3 metadata with your `$EDITOR`.

This program:

1. Recursively scans the current `$PATH` for directories with `.mp3` files.
2. Generates a `.toml` config containing all the current tags formatted to be
   easy to change in vim (but inferior editors are also supported).
3. You change the `.toml` config in the `$EDITOR`.
4. The tags are updated on the `.mp3` files.

The program also finds `.jpg` and `.png` files in the directories with `.mp3`
files and lets you choose one of them as the cover image. The image will be
rescaled to a `512x512px` `JPEG` and embedded into the `.mp3` files.

You can change the tags and cover images for multiple directories at the same
time.

Example:

```toml
["./Gza - Liquid Swords"]
path = "./Gza - Liquid Swords"
metadata = { album = "Liquid Swords", album_artist = "Gza", year = 1995 }

# Order in this list determines track number
music_files = [
     { metadata = { title = "Liquid Swords", artist = "Gza" }, file_path = "01 Gza, Liquid Swords.mp3" }, 
     { metadata = { title = "Duel of the Iron Mic", artist = "Gza" }, file_path = "02 Gza, Duel Of The Iron Mic (Feat. Dreddy Kruger).mp3" }, 
     { metadata = { title = "Living in the World Today", artist = "Gza" }, file_path = "03 Gza, Living In The World Today.mp3" }, 
     { metadata = { title = "Gold", artist = "Gza" }, file_path = "04 Gza, Gold.mp3" }, 
     { metadata = { title = "Cold World", artist = "Gza" }, file_path = "05 Gza, Cold World (Feat. Inspectah Deck & Life).mp3" },
